Implement the following plan:

# Fix: `contactTime < 0f` filter blocks wall-pinning collisions

## Context

The previous fix moved the `contactTime >= 0f` check from `DynamicRectVsRect` into the detection `Update()` as `contactTime < 0f`. Ghost collisions stopped, but collision resolution is still non-functional — entities pass through walls.

## Root Cause

The `contactTime < 0f` check in detection is **inverted in intent**. It blocks exactly the collisions that keep entities pinned to surfaces.

Frame-by-frame trace:
1. Entity approaches floor. `contactTime = 0.43` → detected → resolved → entity placed at floor surface, velocity.Y zeroed.
2. Next frame: gravity re-applies a tiny velocity. `TransformVelocitySystem` pushes entity slightly past the floor surface. `Delta` = tiny downward value.
3. Detection: `DynamicRectVsRect` finds the entity slightly overlapping the floor. `contactTime = -0.01` (slightly negative because entity is already past the contact surface).
4. **Our filter `contactTime < 0f` catches -0.01 → collision BLOCKED.**
5. Entity is not pushed back. Gravity keeps accumulating. Entity falls through floor.

The `-0` values in the logs are the borderline case (IEEE 754 negative zero passes `< 0f` as false, but truly negative values like `-0.01` don't). As the entity approaches slowly, it hovers between detectable and undetectable.

## Fix

Remove `contactTime < 0f` from the detection filter. Keep only the `contactNormal == Vector2.Zero` guard.

`contactNormal == Vector2.Zero` already handles both problem cases:
- Ghost collisions from overlapping static entities (zero-displacement branch returns `contactNormal = Vector2.Zero`)
- Unresolvable diagonal corner hits (`RayVsRect` returns `contactNormal = {0,0}` when `closestDistance.X == closestDistance.Y`)

### Files to change

**`MonoDreams.Examples/System/Collision/TransformCollisionDetectionSystem.cs`** — line 55:
```csharp
// FROM:
if (contactTime < 0f || contactNormal == Vector2.Zero) continue;
// TO:
if (contactNormal == Vector2.Zero) continue;
```

**`MonoDreams/System/Collision/CollisionDetectionSystem.cs`** — line 51:
Same change.

### No other changes needed
- `DynamicRectVsRect` is already correct: `return potentialCollision && contactTime < 1.0f;`
- Resolution systems are unchanged — they re-verify with the unfiltered `DynamicRectVsRect` and apply position correction.

## Verification

1. `dotnet build MonoDreams.Examples/MonoDreams.Examples.csproj`
2. Run the game, load Level 2
3. Confirm: entity stops at walls in all 4 directions (floor, ceiling, left wall, right wall)
4. Confirm: no ghost collision logs at `(0,0)` from overlapping static walls
5. Confirm: no snapping/teleportation when sliding along walls
