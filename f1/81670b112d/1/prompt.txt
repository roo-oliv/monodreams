Implement the following plan:

# Configure macOS Notifications for Claude Code

## Context
You want to be notified when Claude Code needs your attention — whether it's asking a question, requesting permission approval, or finished executing. This avoids having to constantly watch the terminal.

## Approach
Add a **`Notification`** hook to your **global** settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`) so it works across all projects.

The `Notification` event fires for:
- **`idle_prompt`** — Claude is idle waiting for your input (covers both "asking a question" and "done executing")
- **`permission_prompt`** — Claude needs you to approve/deny a tool execution

Using an empty matcher (`""`) catches all notification types, covering all three scenarios you described.

## Changes

**File: `~/.claude/settings.json`**

Add a `hooks` section with a `Notification` hook that uses `osascript` to trigger a native macOS notification:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "osascript -e 'display notification \"Claude Code needs your attention\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Glass\"'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "permissions": { ... existing ... },
  "alwaysThinkingEnabled": true
}
```

The `sound name "Glass"` adds an audible chime so you don't need to be looking at the screen.

## Verification
- Start a new Claude Code session or continue the current one
- Trigger a permission prompt (e.g., run a command that requires approval) — you should see a macOS notification with sound
- Ask Claude a question that causes it to use `AskUserQuestion` — notification should fire when idle
- Let Claude finish a task — notification should fire when done
