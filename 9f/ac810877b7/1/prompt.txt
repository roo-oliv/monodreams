Implement the following plan:

# Fix Level Selection Screen — Buttons Invisible After CullingSystem Fix

## Context

The previous fix made `MasterRenderSystem` require `Visible` on all Main-target
entities. This correctly culls world sprites outside camera bounds, but it also
hides the level selection screen's buttons and title text — they target
`RenderTargetID.Main` but never receive the `Visible` component.

The level selection screen doesn't use `CullingSystem` (no camera-based
culling needed for a menu), so nothing ever adds `Visible` to these entities.

## Fix

**File: `MonoDreams.Examples/Screens/LevelSelectionScreen.cs`**

Set `Visible` on all entities that target `RenderTargetID.Main` at creation
time. Since this screen has no `CullingSystem`, the tag stays permanently —
which is correct for always-on-screen menu UI.

Three places need `entity.Set<Visible>()`:

1. **`CreateTextEntity()`** (line ~155) — the title text entity
2. **`CreateButtonEntity()`** (line ~191) — `buttonTextEntity` (the label)
3. **`CreateButtonEntity()`** (line ~208) — `outlineEntity` (the button border mesh)

The `buttonContainerEntity` does NOT need `Visible` — it has no
`DrawComponent` and is only a transform parent.

## Convention established

The contract for Main-target entities is now: **you must have `Visible` to
render.** On game screens, `CullingSystem` manages this. On UI-only screens
without culling, set it at creation time. HUD/UI render targets are unaffected.

## Files Modified

- `MonoDreams.Examples/Screens/LevelSelectionScreen.cs` — add `Visible` to
  3 entity creation points

## Verification

1. `dotnet build MonoDreams.Examples/MonoDreams.Examples.csproj` — 0 errors
2. Level selection screen: title text and all 3 buttons render correctly
3. Button hover/click interaction still works
4. Cursor still renders (HUD target, unaffected)
5. Entering Level 1 / Level 2: culling still works, sprites outside camera
   bounds are not drawn
