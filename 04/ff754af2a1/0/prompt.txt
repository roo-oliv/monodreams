Implement the following plan:

# Update CLAUDE.md to Reflect Post-Refactoring State

## Context

The core/Examples alignment refactoring is complete (7 commits on `ro/core-examples-alignment`). The CLAUDE.md still describes the pre-refactoring state where "core contains legacy code" and "Examples has the most current patterns." This is now wrong — core IS the authoritative source for all engine infrastructure, and Examples contains only game-specific logic.

## Changes

### File: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

**Section: "About this project" (lines 1-11)**
- Remove "core library contains some legacy code" — legacy code was deleted
- Remove "MonoDreams.Examples/ has the most current and mature patterns" — infrastructure is now in core
- Remove "Always prefer conventions found in MonoDreams.Examples over the core library when they diverge" — core is now authoritative
- Keep the starting point reference to `LoadLevelExampleGameScreen.cs` as the best example of how to wire up a game screen

**Section: "Project structure" (lines 13-20)**
- Update `MonoDreams/` description to reflect it now contains rendering, camera, cursor, collision, physics, entity spawning, level loading, and screen management
- Update `MonoDreams.Examples/` description to clarify it's game-specific logic only (screens, input mapping, dialogue, movement, entity factories, settings)
- Add note that `MonoDreams.YarnSpinner/` is standalone (not referenced by core)

**Section: "Component design" (lines 24-36)**
- Add that `EntityInfo` is string-based in core (`new EntityInfo("Player")`), game code can define its own enum for convenience
- Add that `Transform` is the single spatial component (Position was removed)
- Note that `CameraFollowTarget` is in `MonoDreams.Component` (not a Camera subdirectory, to avoid namespace conflicts)
- Existing DrawComponent/SpriteInfo/Visible guidance is correct and stays

**Section: "Entity creation" (lines 38-45)**
- Update to clarify `IEntityFactory` and `EntitySpawnSystem` are in core (`MonoDreams.EntityFactory` and `MonoDreams.System.EntitySpawn`)
- Note namespace choice: `MonoDreams.EntityFactory` (not `.Entity`) to avoid shadowing `DefaultEcs.Entity`
- BlenderLevelParserSystem guidance is correct and stays

**Section: "Rendering pipeline" (lines 47-56)**
- Add that all rendering infrastructure lives in `MonoDreams.Component.Draw` and `MonoDreams.System.Draw`
- Existing MasterRenderSystem / CullingSystem guidance is correct and stays

**New section: "Collision and physics"**
- `BoxCollider`, `RigidBody`, `Velocity` components in `MonoDreams.Component.Collision` / `.Physics`
- Transform-based collision detection and resolution in `MonoDreams.System.Collision`
- `GravitySystem` in `MonoDreams.System.Physics`

**New section: "Level loading"**
- LDtk and Blender parsers in `MonoDreams.System.Level`
- `LoadLevelRequest` message triggers the pipeline
- `LevelLoadRequestSystem` → parser systems → `EntitySpawnSystem`

**Section: "Workflow" (lines 58-71)**
- Update "check MonoDreams.Examples for existing components" to "check MonoDreams/ (core) first for existing components and systems"
- Keep the advice about extending existing components over creating new ones
- Keep the framework mindset guidance

## Verification
- Read the updated file and confirm it matches the actual codebase structure
- `dotnet build` to confirm nothing was accidentally changed (documentation-only change)
