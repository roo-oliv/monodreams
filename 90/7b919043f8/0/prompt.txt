Implement the following plan:

# Fix: Player and NPC not Y-sorted in Blender Level

## Context

When loading Level 2 (Blender level), Player ("Pete") and NPC ("Boldo") are not Y-sorted with each other. The root cause is a name mismatch: `BlenderLevelParserSystem.ResolveLayerDepth()` tries to match Blender collection names against `DrawLayerMap`, but "Player" and "NPC" don't match any `GameDrawLayer` enum value — the correct one is "Characters". Both entities fall through to `DEFAULT_LAYER_DEPTH = 0.5f`, which `YSortSystem` doesn't recognize as a Y-sorted layer.

## Approach: Add alias support to DrawLayerMap

Add a `WithAlias<TEnum>(string alias, TEnum layer)` method to `DrawLayerMap`. Aliases are stored directly in the existing `_layers` dictionary, so all string-based lookups (`TryGetDepth`, `GetDepth`) work transparently with zero changes to any other system.

This is the cleanest fix because:
- Solves the problem at the right abstraction — `DrawLayerMap` is the single source of truth for name-to-depth mapping
- General-purpose — works for any system using string lookup, not just Blender
- Zero changes to `BlenderLevelParserSystem`, `YSortSystem`, or any other core system
- Follows the framework philosophy of extending existing mechanisms

## Changes

### 1. `MonoDreams/Draw/DrawLayerMap.cs` — Add `WithAlias` method

Add a fluent method that inserts an alias key into `_layers` pointing to the same depth as the given enum layer:

```csharp
public DrawLayerMap WithAlias<TEnum>(string alias, TEnum layer) where TEnum : struct, Enum
{
    var layerName = layer.ToString();
    if (!_layers.TryGetValue(layerName, out var depth))
        throw new ArgumentException($"Layer '{layerName}' not found in map.", nameof(layer));
    _layers[alias] = depth;
    return this;
}
```

### 2. `MonoDreams.Examples/Screens/LoadLevelExampleGameScreen.cs` — Wire up aliases

```csharp
_layers = DrawLayerMap.FromEnum<GameDrawLayer>()
    .WithYSort(GameDrawLayer.Characters)
    .WithAlias("Player", GameDrawLayer.Characters)
    .WithAlias("NPC", GameDrawLayer.Characters);
```

## Verification

1. Build: `dotnet build MonoDreams.Examples/MonoDreams.Examples.csproj`
2. Run the game, load Level 2 (Blender level), and verify Player and NPC Y-sort correctly (entity lower on screen renders in front)
