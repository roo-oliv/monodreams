Implement the following plan:

# Fix: Y-sort parent-child gap still allows entities to slip between parent and child

## Context

The PostUpdate pass in `YSortSystem` (added in the previous iteration) correctly derives the
child's depth from the parent's final depth. However, **it still uses the original
`YSortDepthBias` value (-0.0005f) as the offset**, creating a gap of 0.0005 in depth space.

### Why the gap is too large

The Characters Y-sort range spans 0.098 (from `DrawLayerMap`: 11 enum members, step=0.1,
halfStep=0.05, margin=0.001 → range width = 0.098). A bias of -0.0005 in this range
corresponds to roughly 1 world unit of Y at typical camera zoom:

    gap_in_world_units = 0.0005 × boundsHeight / 0.098

At boundsHeight ≈ 200 → gap ≈ 1.02 world units. Pete can easily be within 1 world unit
of the elephant's effective sort Y, landing in the gap between parent and child depths.

## Fix: Use minimal epsilon in PostUpdate instead of full YSortDepthBias

**File**: `MonoDreams/System/Draw/YSortSystem.cs` (lines 83-86, PostUpdate)

**Current code** (produces gap of 0.0005):
```csharp
childDraw.LayerDepth = Math.Clamp(
    parentDraw.LayerDepth + childSprite.YSortDepthBias,
    minDepth, maxDepth);
```

**Fixed code** (produces gap of 1e-6 — ~0.002 world units, sub-pixel):
```csharp
// Preserve bias direction but use a minimal epsilon so no external
// entity's depth can occupy the gap between parent and child
float minimalBias = Math.Sign(childSprite.YSortDepthBias) * 1e-6f;
childDraw.LayerDepth = Math.Clamp(
    parentDraw.LayerDepth + minimalBias,
    minDepth, maxDepth);
```

### Why 1e-6 is safe
- At depth ~0.65, float precision is ~6e-8 (1 ULP). A delta of 1e-6 is ~16 ULPs —
  reliably distinguishable by SpriteBatch's float comparison.
- Gap in world units: 1e-6 × 200 / 0.098 ≈ 0.002 — sub-pixel, impossible to hit in gameplay.
- The sign of the original bias is preserved: negative = behind parent, positive = in front.

## Verification

1. `dotnet build MonoDreams.Examples/MonoDreams.Examples.csproj`
2. Run game, walk Pete to the exact Y level of the elephant-kid NPC — the silhouette should
   always render directly behind the NPC, never with Pete in between
