## The editor reuses the game's real pipeline via run-state gating, not a forked renderer

The level editor is an in-game **mode**, not a separate application. In
`RunMode.Edit` the same world, the same `Camera`, and the same draw stack the
player sees (`CullingSystem → SpritePrepSystem → YSortSystem → MeshPrepSystem →
TextPrepSystem → MasterRenderSystem`) stay live, so the editor previews exactly
what ships. Edit-mode behaviour is produced by **gating** the existing game
pipeline through `GatedSystem` + `EditTimeBehavior`, never by registering a
parallel editor renderer or maintaining a second editor-only scene model. Render
/ input / cursor and `HierarchySystem` run in both modes (`RunNormally`); game
logic / physics / camera-follow take `Freeze`; editor systems run on top,
Edit-guarded.

**Why:** cornerstone of the design (`docs/CORE_TENETS.md` — "The editor is part
of the game"): a separate editor renderer drifts from the game renderer and the
"what you edit is what ships" guarantee is lost. Reusing the pipeline also means
the editor inherits every rendering fix for free.
**Breaks:** a parallel renderer or a second data model means the edited scene and
the played scene diverge (a sprite that culls/Y-sorts differently in the editor
than in play); a black screen if the render module is wrongly frozen in Edit, or
physics that keeps moving entities while the designer is placing them if the
game systems are not `Freeze`-gated.
**Tests:** `MonoDreams.Tests/Foundation/RunStateGatingTest.cs` (the gating
mechanism this premise relies on: `Freeze` skips in Edit, `RunNormally` runs in
both); the matrix-level assertion that render stays live and physics freezes lands
with the editor screen in Wave 4.
**Depends on:** foundation — "Edit-time behavior is a per-system policy honored by
`GatedSystem`"; rendering — "Rendering systems run last in the pipeline".

## The component-serializer registry is opt-in per type; unregistered components are skipped-with-warning, not silently dropped

A scene serializes only the component types explicitly **registered** on the
`ComponentSerializerRegistry` (`Type` → a `(write, read)` pair keyed by a stable string).
The engine ships serializers for its serializable components via
`EngineComponentSerializers.RegisterEngineComponents` (`TransformComponent`,
`SpriteInfoComponent`, `EntityInfoComponent`, the colliders, `RigidBodyComponent`,
`VelocityComponent`, and the `ChildOfComponent` parent link); **game code registers
serializers for its own components** (e.g. `PlayerState`) through `registry.Register`.
Engine tags and transient state (`VisibleComponent`, `ColliderTagComponent`, cursor state,
`DrawComponent`) are deliberately **not** registered — they are re-derived by their systems.
When the writer encounters a component on an entity with no registered serializer, it
**skips that component and emits a `Logger.Warning`** — never a silent drop. (Registration
runs once at module/screen init, so the in-scope component set is explicit and greppable.)

**Why:** the round-trip must reconstruct from components, not by re-running factories
(GAP-A); opt-in keeps engine tags + transient state out of the file, and the loud warning
turns a dropped component into a visible signal rather than the missing-entity class of bug
(mirrors level-loading — "Unregistered factory identifiers log a warning"). Game-component
registration is the framework-not-library extension seam.
**Breaks:** registering by default (or auto-serializing every component) would write
transient tags (`VisibleComponent`) and unserializable state into the file; silently
dropping an unregistered component loses a designer's data with no signal.
**Tests:** `MonoDreams.Tests/LevelEditor/ComponentSerializerRegistryTest.cs`
(`Registry_OptIn_SkipsUnregisteredEngineTags`,
`UnregisteredComponentWarning.SerializeEntity_WithUnregisteredComponent_SkipsAndWarns_DoesNotThrow`,
`GameComponent_RegistersOwnSerializer_AndRoundTrips`, `Deserialize_WithUnregisteredKey_ThrowsLoud`).
**Depends on:** level-loading — "Unregistered factory identifiers log a warning and silently
drop the spawn" (the analogous loud-on-the-unexpected stance).

## `SpriteInfoComponent` serializes an `AssetKey`, never the live `Texture2D`

A `Texture2D` is a GPU resource, not serializable data. `SpriteInfoComponent` carries an
additive optional `AssetKey` (string, nullable, default `null`) — the content key the
texture was loaded from (e.g. `"Atlas/TX Player"`). The serializer persists the key and
the source sprite fields, and **never** the live `SpriteSheet`. On load the texture is
rehydrated via `ContentManager.Load(assetKey)` (Wave 3's reader); after a Wave-2 in-memory
deserialize, `SpriteSheet` is `null`.

**Why:** the live texture can't round-trip through JSON; the asset key is the serializable
stand-in. The field is additive + optional so every existing `SpriteInfoComponent`
construction site is unaffected (back-compat).
**Breaks:** attempting to serialize the `Texture2D` either fails or bakes a GPU handle that
is meaningless on reload; omitting the key leaves a loaded sprite with no way to find its
texture.
**Tests:** `MonoDreams.Tests/LevelEditor/ComponentSerializerRegistryTest.cs`
(`SpriteInfo_Serialization_CarriesAssetKey_AndSourceSortFields_NeverLiveTexture`,
`RoundTrip_ReproducesRegisteredComponents_AndParentLink`).
**Depends on:** rendering — `SpriteInfoComponent` is the source sprite-data struct.

## The serializer persists SOURCE sort fields, never the per-frame-derived `DrawComponent.LayerDepth`

`SpriteInfoComponent`'s serializer writes the SOURCE sort fields — `LayerDepth`,
`YSortOffset`, `YSortDepthBias` — and **never** `DrawComponent.LayerDepth`, which
`SpritePrepSystem` / `YSortSystem` rewrite every frame from those source fields and the
entity's world Y. Persisting the derived depth would bake one camera frame's Y-sort result
into the file; persisting the source fields lets the next prep+sort frame after load
recompute the same derived depth deterministically.

**Why:** the derived-value table's "persisted sort fields are SOURCE not derived" row — the
derived depth is a function of camera bounds + world Y, so it is not stable to persist.
**Breaks:** a scene saved while the camera framed one region reloads with every sprite's
depth frozen to that frame, so Y-sorting is wrong until something forces a re-sort.
**Tests:** `MonoDreams.Tests/LevelEditor/ComponentSerializerRegistryTest.cs`
(`SpriteInfo_Serialization_CarriesAssetKey_AndSourceSortFields_NeverLiveTexture` asserts the
SOURCE fields are written; the derived-depth *reproduction* across a full save→load frame is
`DerivedDepthReproductionTest`, planned with the Wave-3 reader).
**Depends on:** rendering — "Layer depth ownership" (`SpritePrepSystem` → `YSortSystem` →
`MasterRenderSystem` rewrite `DrawComponent.LayerDepth` each frame).

## Planned premises (land with their code in later waves — text + named test pre-committed)

These are **not yet live** (their code does not exist yet). They are
recorded here so the implementing wave drops in the premise verbatim and wires
the named test in the same PR — honoring the repo rule that no premise ships
`Tests: none yet`.

- **"Scene round-trip reconstructs from registered components, not factories."**
  (Wave 3) Save = the registered components of every `SceneObjectComponent` root
  plus its `ChildOfComponent` closure; load = two passes (create + deserialize via
  the registry, rehydrate `Texture2D` from the asset key, then wire the parent
  graph) on a dedicated `LoadSceneRequest`. **Tests:** `SceneRoundTripGoldenTest`,
  `MembershipFilterTest`, `DerivedDepthReproductionTest`. **Depends on:**
  level-loading — `LoadLevelRequest` is LDtk-coupled. **Note (Wave 2):** the
  component-serialization *engine* of this premise is already live — the opt-in
  registry, the in-memory `SceneSerializer` two-pass create-then-wire-parents
  round-trip, and the `AssetKey`/SOURCE-sort-field rules above are tested by
  `ComponentSerializerRegistryTest` with hand-built entities. Wave 3 adds the
  `SceneObjectComponent` membership filter, the JSON file writer/reader through
  `IPlatformServices`, `Texture2D` rehydration, and the `LoadSceneRequest` dispatch.
- **"Editor-overlay entities are standalone; delete snapshots the sub-graph."**
  (Wave 4) Gizmo / selection / toolbar entities are never `ChildOfComponent`-parented
  to game entities, so `HierarchySystem.DisposeOrphans` (live in Edit) cannot
  cascade-dispose them; delete is an undo command that snapshots the disposed
  sub-graph. **Tests:** `HierarchyLiveInEditTest`, `DeleteUndoSnapshotTest`.
  **Depends on:** foundation — "Children are disposed with their parents".
- **"Bounded undo with drag-coalescing."** (Wave 4) Configurable cap with
  oldest-evicted FIFO; one full gizmo drag = exactly one undo step; empty-stack
  undo is a no-op. **Tests:** `UndoBoundedCapTest`, `DragCoalescingTest`.
  **Depends on:** —.
- **"Selection picks MAX final `LayerDepth` with a selection-owned tiebreak."**
  (Wave 4) The selected entity is the one rendered frontmost (MAX post-YSort
  `LayerDepth`) with a deterministic selection-owned tiebreak, because the
  renderer's insertion index is private. **Tests:** `SelectionTopmostTest`,
  `SelectionOrderingTest`. **Depends on:** rendering — final sort key.
